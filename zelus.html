                Zelus is a powerful real-time stats visualizer and projection system developed for NHL games. This innovative system takes live match data and projects it directly onto the ice surface during period breaks, creating an immersive fan experience. As a Real Time Developer at Quince Imaging, I played a key role in programming core features and managing multiple system updates over the project's lifecycle.
