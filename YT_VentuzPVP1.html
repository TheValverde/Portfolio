                I made this project with the hopes of introducing new Ventuz users into how to get into the workflow. As someone with good professional experience using Ventuz, I am comfortable with how to create templates like this from my past work.<br><br>To make this video, I actually needed to do a lot of preparation. To start the project, I created a json structure of the information I knew I would require. The jsons are provided in the project repository. I had ChatGPT generate fictional data to fill out the team information and player rosters. Afterwards, I had ChatGPT generate visual descriptions for all of the players. I used these descriptions with Midjourney to create the players that were used in the project. The same step was done for the team logos and the league logo. Of course, these images were fed to me with a background, so I had to remove them with Photoshop. <br>To have a rough idea of my layout, I used Figma. I also used Canva to remove a background for a logo since that was working better than rotoing everything in Photoshop. After I had my data and assets prepared, I began working on a script through Highland 2. After a few hours the script was polished and ready to record. <br><br>Recording it took around 30 minutes. I then used Adobe Audition to clean up the audio to the best of my ability. Opening up the voice over from the script that I had just recorded, I used OBS to screen record the programming, trying to follow along with the voice over as close as I could. This allowed me to gauge whether the video would be moving too fast for a user. If I couldn't keep up with myself, I wouldn't expect a new user to be able to do so either. After the programming was recorded, I threw everything in to Premiere Pro to chop things up together. Created some text effects to add clarity to the video within there as well and then rendered. <br><br>To make the thumbnail, I used Midjourney to come up with ideas as well. Once I found a thumbnail layout idea that I liked, I used Midjourney to create a background of my liking. I took this background into Adobe Illustrator, where I created the custom shape that is seen in the thumbnail, as well as add the title into it, using the Midjourney generated image as the background.<br><br> All in all, this project took around 15 hours since it's inception. The longest part ended up being learning the workflow for the Adobe Suite which, I was unfamiliar with for the most part. I had never done video editing with Premiere Pro before, never used Adobe Audition and it'd been years since I touched Illustrator! Overall, this project was a great learning experience and I hope I was able to contribute to the community with it as well!
