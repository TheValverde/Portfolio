                Created an AI Agent for personal use with coding capabilities, that integrates with MCP servers. This agent is hosted on my Ubuntu Server, with a mirror on my Windows desktop. Both utilize another MCP server I made to input CLI commands to help manage the full environment on the Ubuntu server. It also does daily diagnostics, and takes in system resources, which through clever engineering, outputs whether we can run more services, cut back, and even recommends other services to run. This has already served me to spin up game servers, configure firewall, easily monitor and manage all my docker containers, and tune my compose stack. Not to mention the countless times it's ensured we stay within the very limited system resources and provided optimizations I wouldn't have thought off in the moment!
