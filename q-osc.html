                As a programmer, I was tasked with coming up with a straight forward, user-friendly solution to a problem. The problem being, how do we get a user to map an OSC message to specific keys and then send those out when the key is pressed to a specified server. Q-OSC took one weekend to program, and was my first Python desktop application that I shipped out. The application used customtkinter for the frontend and pythonosc for the backend, as well as a json data structure for storing settings. Overall, the end-client was thrilled with the quick turn around and ease of use of the application. This was made during my time at Quince Imaging. The application is still receiving continuous updates and having new features added to it, to this day.
